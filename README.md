# sqlAlchemy Challenge with Climate Data
Challenge 10 for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this challenge, we use sqlAlchemy to analyze the climate data in Hawaii to plan our long holiday vacation!

### Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
Python and SQLAlchemy are used to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the Hawaii climate database (found in the "Resources" folder). Specifically, SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib are used to complete the analysis. 

This initial analysis is saved in the jupyter notebook named "climate_data.ipynb".

### Part 2: Design Your Climate App
After completion of the initial analysis, a Flask API was designed based on the queries developed in "climate_data.ipnyb". 

The climate app is saved in a python file named "app.py".
